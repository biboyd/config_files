# config_files
Just some of the configuration files I use for different software. Made just so I could keep track of somethings and the changes I make. Also, if anyone finds this they are free to borrow anything that they didn't know about before.

### Notes
One note I should mention is for my i3 config file I use [i3lock-fancy-multimonitor](https://github.com/guimeira/i3lock-fancy-multimonitor) as my screen locker. Otherwise, most things in here should be pretty vanilla.
